**Customizable navigation bar** is an addon that allows users to add, modify, or remove links in the Scratch website's navigation bar, as well as tweak the user dropdown and change the bar's page scrolling behavior.

## Background

Scratch removed the discuss button that linked to the forums in July 2017.[^1] The original addon was introduced to bring it back and included an option to remove the ideas link.

## Features

- Add new links to Scratch pages or other websites.
- Re-order links and change their labels.
- Remove existing links.
- Prevent the navigation bar from scrolling with the page.
- Move the logged-in username out of the way.

## Settings

### Items

Controls the links displayed between the Scratch logo and search bar. Each item has the following inputs:

- Name: The link's label
- URL: The page to link to which can be relative to the home page (e.g. /mystuff) or absolute (e.g. https://example.com).

### Compact user dropdown

Moves the username of the logged-in user into the profile dropdown item.

### Stick to

- Top of screen: The navigation bar stays visible even when the page scrolls. This is Scratch's default behavior.
- Top of page: The navigation bar stays at the top of the page and scrolls away with it.

The original addon was written by WorldLanguages, and TheColaber was the author of the rewrite.
