## Alternatives

In case you need an alternative, here are some choices.

- Create a issue on [the repository](https://github.com/ScratchAddons/ScratchAddons/issues).

- Send a message on [our support Discord server](https://discord.gg/R5NBqwMjNc)
- Contact one of the contributors directly

It is discouraged to contact one of the contributors through Scratch due to [the policy that forbids advertising extensions/userscripts](https://scratch.mit.edu/discuss/post/2907564/).

By the way, we have [a FAQ page](https://scratchaddons.com/docs/faq/) for your usual questions.
