**Thanks for being interested on volunteering to translate Scratch Addons to other languages!**

Scratch Addons is a non-profit open source project where volunteer web developers maintain the extension and create its addons. 

Even if you haven't ever coded a single line of JavaScript, you can still help us achieve our goal of making everyone's experience with Scratch better!

**All you need to do is know both English and another language, and spend a few minutes a week translating any new sentences Scratch Addons added during that period.** 

This way, anyone that speaks your language can use Scratch Addons in their native language, instead of having to understand English.

**If you're interested in helping, please follow these steps:**

- Go to [our Transifex page](https://www.transifex.com/scratch-addons/scratch-addons-extension/), and click on the blue "Help Translate Scratch Addons" button.
- Use the same username as your Scratch account. Enter your email, a new password, then Sign Up.
- Enter your username as your name and surname - **do not use your real name**.
_Note: choose any option for "department" and "job title", we recommend "localization" and "individual contributor"_
- On then next step, select "join an existing project".
- Choose the language you want to help with.

You'll soon be accepted into the Transifex team and you'll get email notifications when there are new strings to translate.

### Notes:

- Scratch must be translated in that language.
- Unlike Scratch, we only support one dialect per language (Scratch Addons will never have Latin American Spanish, nor Portugal Portuguese).
- It may take a few hours/days before your request is accepted.
- If you get accepted, you may add yourself (or be added) to our [website's contributors page](https://scratchaddons.com/contributors).
- Legal stuff: your translations will be licensed under the same license as Scratch Addons (GPL v3.0)

### Any questions?

If you have any questions about translating, feel free to [open a discussion](https://github.com/ScratchAddons/ScratchAddons/discussions) (GitHub account required) or [send feedback](https://scratchaddons.com/feedback) (no account required, but make sure to specify your Scratch username).
