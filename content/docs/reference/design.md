## Icons
We use iconify UIL (Unicons) icons. See them at https://iconify.design/icon-sets/uil/. Please only use icons from this set unless you have explicit permission to use another set. When adding an icon, download it to ``/images/icons/iconname.svg``. 

## Colors
Our color theme is orange ![#1589F0](https://dummyimage.com/15x15/ff7b26/ff7b26&text=+) `#ff7b26` and white ![#fff](https://dummyimage.com/15x15/fff/000&text=+) `#fff`. These colors make up the top bar on our webpages, as well as some other elements. 

For our (default) dark theme, our main colors are ![#1589F0](https://dummyimage.com/15/2a2a2a/000000?text=+) `#2a2a2a` ![#1589F0](https://dummyimage.com/15x15/222/000000?text=+) `#222` ![#1589F0](https://dummyimage.com/15x15/000/000000?text=+) `#000`.

For our light theme, our main colors are ![#1589F0](https://dummyimage.com/15/f0f0f0/000000?text=+) `#f0f0f0` ![#f0f0f0](https://dummyimage.com/15/aaa/000000?text=+) `#aaa` ![#1589F0](https://dummyimage.com/15/dddddd/000000?text=+) `#dddddd`.

There are of course many other colors we use around our pages, but these colors are most common.
