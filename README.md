These are the files behind the Scratch Addons website. It is built with Hugo as the static site generator, Bootstrap 4 as the CSS framework, and GitHub Pages as the hosting provider. The website is built with accessibility and readability in mind, and is mobile-compatible.

Check out [the repo wiki](https://github.com/ScratchAddons/website-v2/wiki) for documentation related to the website.

## Building

2. Serve the website for development (`localhost:1313` by default):

```batch
hugo -D serve
```
